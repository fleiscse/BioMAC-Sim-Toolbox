function problem = running2D(model, resultfile, trackingData, targetSpeed, isSymmetric, initialGuess)

%% 1. Fixed settings
% We can choose the number of collocation nodes.
nNodes = 100;   
% Most of the time we use backard euler for discretization which is encoded with 'BE'.
Euler = 'BE';
% We usually use the name of the resultfile for the name of the logfile
logfile = resultfile;
% We want to plot intermediate results during solving of the problem.
plotLog = 1;


%% 2. Create collocation problem
problem = Collocation(model, nNodes, Euler, logfile, plotLog);


%% 3. Add states and controls including their bounds and initial values to the problem
% Get upper and lower bounds of the model and resize it
xmin = repmat(model.states.xmin, 1, nNodes+1); %We use one more than the number of nodes since the last node (the +1) one is then used in the periodicity constraint
xmax = repmat(model.states.xmax, 1, nNodes+1);

% Adapt the bounds for the first node to start the movement at X = 0
xmax(model.extractState('q', 'pelvis_tx'), 1) = 0;
xmin(model.extractState('q', 'pelvis_tx'), 1) = 0; 

% Add states (initial values will be specified later)
problem.addOptimVar('states', xmin, xmax);

% Add controls to the problem using the default bounds (initial values will be specified later)
problem.addOptimVar('controls',repmat(model.controls.xmin,1,nNodes+1), repmat(model.controls.xmax,1,nNodes+1));

% Add duration of the movement 
problem.addOptimVar('dur',0.2, 2);

% Add speed in x direction of the movement. We choose here targetspeed for
% the lower and upper bound to ensure that we have exactly this speed. You
% could also choose other bounds.
problem.addOptimVar('speed',targetSpeed, targetSpeed);

% After adding all the components to X, we can use a previous solution as
% initial guess. In this case, we use the standing solution we produced
% before.
problem.makeinitialguess(initialGuess); 



%% 4. Add objective terms to the problem
% For this simulation, we want to track angles and GRFs. We choose a weight
% of 1.
Wtracking = 1;
% We have to resample the trackingData to the number of nodes
trackingData.resampleData(nNodes);
% We select the signals we want to track
GRFSignals   = {'GRF_x_r', 'GRF_y_r', 'GRF_x_l', 'GRF_y_l'};
AngleSignals = {'hip_flexion_r', 'knee_angle_r', 'ankle_angle_r', 'hip_flexion_l', 'knee_angle_l', 'ankle_angle_l'};
% Even if we use two functions to track angles and GRFs, we want to weight
% all signals equally. Hence, we have to weight it with the number of
% signals.
nGRF   = length(GRFSignals);
nAngle = length(AngleSignals);
nAll   = nGRF + nAngle;
% Add the tracking term for the GRFs and hand over a table containing only
% the signals we want to track
problem.addObjective(@trackGRF   , Wtracking*nGRF/nAll  , trackingData.extractData('GRF', GRFSignals));
% Add the tracking term for the angles and hand over a table containing only
% the signals we want to track
problem.addObjective(@trackAngles, Wtracking*nAngle/nAll, trackingData.extractData('angle', AngleSignals));

% The human body can perform one movement using different muscle activation
% patterns. Since humans choose an efficient way to move, we also add an
% effort term here.
% The weighting of the different terms is a bit tricky. Here we choose 100
% for the effort term since this simulation was written to predict changes
% in the movement. One application would be to predict running with an
% lower leg prosthesis.
Weffort = 100;
% In the effort term, we use equal weighting of all muscles independent from their volume.
weightsType = 'equal'; 
% In the effort term, we want to use the cubic neural excitation of the muscles.
exponent = 3; 
% Add the effort term
problem.addObjective(@effortTermMuscles, Weffort, weightsType, exponent); 

% Additionally, we add a small regulatization term. This ensures smooth
% movements and helps the solver to converge more easily. 
Wreg = 0.0001;
problem.addObjective(@regTerm, Wreg);


%% 5. Add constraints to the problem
% Similar to the standing simulation, we have to ensure that the dynamic
% constraints of the model are fullfiled. 
problem.addConstraint(@dynamicConstraints,repmat(model.constraints.fmin,1,nNodes),repmat(model.constraints.fmax,1,nNodes))

% Furthermore, we now that a gait cycle is a period movement. We use this
% knowledge to limit the possible soluations.
problem.addConstraint(@periodicityConstraint,zeros(model.nStates+model.nControls,1),zeros(model.nStates+model.nControls,1),isSymmetric)
